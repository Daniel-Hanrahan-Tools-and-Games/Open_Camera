# Open_Camera

A Software solution where anyone can use a homemade digital camera.

If you are going to use this with a Raspberry Pi with ADC then you will need the ADC driver.

If you are going to use this with an Arduino then you will need the Arduino driver.

How to build a homemade digital camera:
What you will need:
<ul>
  <li>box with right size hole for lens and place to add motor</li>
  <li>lens</li>
  <li>motor that is powerful enough to turn a nipkow disc</li>
  <li>dichroic prism</li>
  <li>3 photoresistors</li>
  <li>nipkow disc</li>
</ul>
Steps to build your own homemade digital camera:
<ol>
  <li>Attach lens to lens hole in box using tape or glue.</li>
  <li>Attach motor to place on box for motor.</li>
  <li>Attach dichroic prism behind the lens inside the box</li>
  <li>Attach a photoresistor behind the dichroic prism, that will be your green photoresistor.</li>
  <li>Attach a photoresistor to the left of the dichroic prism, that will be your red or blue photoresistor. To find out if that will be your red or blue photo resistor, aim a white light at your dichroic prism at the opposite side of your green photoresistor.</li>
  <li>Attach a photoresistor to the right of the dichroic prism, that will be your red or blue photoresistor. To find out if that will be your red or blue photo resistor, aim a white light at your dichroic prism at the opposite side of your green photoresistor./li>
  <li>Do the necessary wiring for each photoresistor.</li>
  <li>Finally attach the nipkow disc through the middle of the disc to the motor and line the holes on the disc with the lens hole.</li>
</ol>
